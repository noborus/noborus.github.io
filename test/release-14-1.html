    A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.
   </p><p>
    However, note that installations using physical replication should
    update standby servers before the primary server, as explained in
    the third changelog entry below.
   </p><p>
    Also, several bugs have been found that may have resulted in corrupted
    indexes, as explained in the next several changelog entries.  If any
    of those cases apply to you, it's recommended to reindex
    possibly-affected indexes after updating.

      Make the server reject extraneous data after an SSL or GSS
      encryption handshake (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.
      This could be abused to send faked SQL commands to the server,
      although that would only work if the server did not demand any
      authentication data.  (However, a server relying on SSL certificate
      authentication might well not do so.)

      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.
      This could probably be abused to inject faked responses to the
      client's first few queries, although other details of libpq's
      behavior make that harder than it sounds.  A different line of
      attack is to exfiltrate the client's password, or other sensitive
      data that might be sent early in the session.  That has been shown
      to be possible with a server vulnerable to CVE-2021-23214.

      Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes
      after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>
      If the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the
      rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery
      logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning
      of the incomplete WAL record.  This is problematic since standby
      servers may already have copies of that WAL segment.  They will then
      see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover
      without manual intervention.  To fix, do not back up over a WAL
      segment boundary when restarting after a crash.  Instead write a new
      type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing
      readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and
      must be disregarded.
     </p><p>
      When applying this update, it's best to update standby servers
      before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new
      WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.

      Ensure that parallel <code class="command">VACUUM</code> doesn't miss any
      indexes (Peter Geoghegan, Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>
      A parallel <code class="command">VACUUM</code> would fail to process indexes
      that are below the <code class="varname">min_parallel_index_scan_size</code>
      cutoff, if the table also has at least two indexes that are above
      that size.  This could result in those indexes becoming corrupt,
      since they'd still contain references to any heap entries removed by
      the <code class="command">VACUUM</code>; subsequent queries using such indexes
      would be likely to return rows they shouldn't.
      This problem does not affect autovacuum, since it doesn't use
      parallel vacuuming.  However, it is advisable to reindex any
      manually-vacuumed tables that have the right mix of index sizes.

      Rows inserted by just-prepared transactions might be omitted from

      If a function in <code class="literal">FROM</code> laterally references the
      output of some sub-<code class="literal">SELECT</code> earlier in
      the <code class="literal">FROM</code> clause, and we are able to flatten that
      sub-<code class="literal">SELECT</code> into the outer query, the

      There are corner cases in which <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> will

      If a procedure commits or rolls back a transaction, and then its

      management went wrong, leading to a dangling pointer and probable

      Use the CLDR project's data to map Windows time zone names to IANA
      time zones (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      When running on Windows, <span class="application">initdb</span> attempts
      to set the new cluster's <code class="varname">timezone</code> parameter to
      the IANA time zone matching the system's prevailing time zone.
      We were using a mapping table that we'd generated years ago and
      updated only fitfully; unsurprisingly, it contained a number of
      errors as well as omissions of recently-added zones.  It turns out
      that CLDR has been tracking the most appropriate mappings, so start
      using their data.  This change will not affect any existing
      installation, only newly-initialized clusters.

      Also, the Pacific/Enderbury zone has been renamed to Pacific/Kanton.
      Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous
      zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Africa/Accra,
      America/Atikokan, America/Blanc-Sablon, America/Creston,
      America/Curacao, America/Nassau, America/Port_of_Spain,
      Antarctica/DumontDUrville, and Antarctica/Syowa.
      In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias.
