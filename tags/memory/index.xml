      <description>Memory management Regular file ov is managed by dividing it into Chunks for each ChunkSize (10,000) lines. For example, a file with 73210 lines is divided into 7 chunks.
The first Chunk (Chunk0) is always loaded into memory. Chunk3 and Chunk4 must also be loaded into memory, as they may span two Chunks when displayed. Chunk1 and Chunk2 have been used before and are loaded into memory, but can be freed if they exceed their limits.</description>
